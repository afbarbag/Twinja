Twinja For Twitter is an app that records voice periodically and tweets it to a Twitter account automatically. The frequency of recording is controlled by the user as is the Twitter account to which the tweet will come from. The user can log in with their own account or use the Twinja For Twitter public account, @TwinjaNinja.
